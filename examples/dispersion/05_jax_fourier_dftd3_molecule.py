JAX FourierD3: Particle-Mesh Dispersion Under ``jax.jit``
=========================================================

FourierD3 evaluates the DFT-D3(BJ) correction on a particle mesh, so the dispersion sum
carries no real-space cutoff and the only neighbour list left is the short one the
coordination numbers need. The JAX binding is the counterpart of
:func:`nvalchemiops.torch.interactions.dispersion.fourier_dftd3`, and the argument list is the
same minus ``device``.

Eager JAX dispatches each of the nine passes separately, and that overhead dominates a
correction this cheap. Wrapping the call in :func:`jax.jit` is what makes it worth using, so
that is what this example concentrates on.

In this example you will learn:

- How to build ``FourierD3Parameters`` for the JAX API
- How to evaluate the correction, and what the returned virial means
- How to ``jax.jit`` the call, and which arguments have to be static to do so

# %%
# Summary
# -------
#
# - ``FourierD3Parameters.from_tables`` decomposes the reference tensor once per species set,
#   on the host, independently of the functional.
# - ``fourier_dftd3`` is periodic only, needs a coordination-number list whose cutoff equals
#   ``r_cut``, and takes exactly one of ``mesh_dimensions`` or ``mesh_spacing``.
# - Under ``jax.jit`` the shape-determining arguments must be static; the arrays stay traced,
#   so one compiled step serves a whole trajectory at fixed neighbour-list length.
# - Mesh, spline, modulus, decomposition, dtype, and rank-chunk controls are explicit; this
#   example does not select or recommend calibrated values for another application.
# - Forces and the virial are returned directly rather than obtained by differentiation.
#
# For open boundary conditions, or for small systems where the truncation error does not
# matter, :func:`nvalchemiops.jax.interactions.dispersion.dftd3` remains the right choice.
