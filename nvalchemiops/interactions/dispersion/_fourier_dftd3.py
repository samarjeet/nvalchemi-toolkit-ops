FourierD3: Particle-Mesh Evaluation of the DFT-D3 Dispersion Correction
======================================================================

Evaluates the periodic DFT-D3(BJ) dispersion energy by particle-mesh summation, in
:math:`O(N \log N)` and **without a real-space cutoff on the dispersion sum**. The only
real-space cutoff that remains is the short coordination-number list, which a machine-learned
force field already builds for its own descriptors.

Why a mesh method is possible here
----------------------------------

Mesh summation needs the pairwise coefficient to separate into atom-centred factors. D3's
:math:`C_6` coefficients do not separate: they couple the coordination numbers of both atoms.
A low-rank decomposition of the reference tensor, computed once on the host by
:mod:`nvalchemiops.interactions.dispersion._c6_decomposition`, restores separability:

.. math::

    C_6^{ij} = \sum_{\ell} \lambda_{\ell}\, c_6[i, \ell]\, c_6[j, \ell]

Each rank slot then spreads onto its own mesh channel and is summed independently.

Becke-Johnson damping supplies the second ingredient. It makes the pair potential bounded and
absolutely integrable, so Poisson summation applies directly and the transform is available in
closed form with an exponentially decaying envelope. **There is no Ewald splitting parameter
and no real-space dispersion sum**: the mesh Nyquist frequency is the only truncation. This is
the main structural difference from the electrostatics PME path in this package.

Pass structure
--------------

Warp has no full-mesh FFT, so as with PME the transforms are performed by the calling
framework and this module supplies the surrounding kernels. Bindings drive the sequence:

===== =========================================================== ==============
Pass  Operation                                                   Performed by
===== =========================================================== ==============
1     Coordination numbers from the neighbour list                this module
2     Reference weights, low-rank coefficients, ``dc6/dCN``       this module
3     B-spline spread onto the ``(system, species, rank)`` mesh   ``math.spline``
4     Forward real-to-complex FFT                                 framework
5     Reciprocal-space contraction, energy and virial             this module
6     Inverse FFT of the cotangent field                          framework
7     Gather ``dE/dc6`` and the direct mesh forces                ``math.spline``
8     Self-energy, and its contribution to ``dE/dc6``             this module
9     Contract to ``dE/dCN`` and apply the chain rule to forces   this module
===== =========================================================== ==============

Pass 8 must run before pass 9: the self-energy is quadratic in the coefficients, which depend
on coordination number, so applying it as a final scalar correction would drop its
contribution from every force and from the virial.

Units
-----
Unit-agnostic, but every length must share one system: ``positions``, ``cell``, ``rcov``,
``r_cut`` and the mesh spacing. The DFT-D3 reference parameters are conventionally in atomic
units. ``r_cut`` must equal the cutoff the neighbour list was built with, because the
coordination-number function is constructed to reach zero exactly there.

    Consumes the forward real-to-complex transform of the spread mesh and produces the
    reciprocal-space energy together with the cotangent field.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mesh_fft : wp.array4d, shape (B * n_species * rank, nx, ny, nz // 2 + 1), dtype=wp.vec2f
        or wp.vec2d
        Transformed mesh, real and imaginary parts adjacent. Channel
        ``(b * n_species + species) * rank + slot``.
    k_matrix : wp.array, shape (B,), dtype=wp.mat33f or wp.mat33d
        ``2 * pi * inverse(cell)`` per system, so that ``k_matrix @ miller`` is the Cartesian
        wave vector.
    moduli_x, moduli_y, moduli_z : wp.array
        B-spline attenuation per axis, lengths ``nx``, ``ny`` and ``nz // 2 + 1``.
    volumes : wp.array, shape (B,)
        Cell volume per system.
    sqrt_q : wp.array, shape (n_species,)
        Square root of the quadrupole-to-dipole ratio per species channel.
    eigs : wp.array, shape (rank,)
        Eigenvalues of the decomposed reference tensor. May be negative.
    s6, s8, a1, a2 : float
        Becke-Johnson damping parameters. These are the only source of the damping used
        anywhere in the evaluation.
    mesh_dimensions : tuple[int, int, int]
        Full mesh size, before the real-to-complex transform halves the last axis.
    n_species, rank : int
        Channel layout of ``mesh_fft``.
    energy : wp.array, shape (B,)
        OUTPUT: accumulated reciprocal-space energy. Must be zero-initialised.
    cotangent : wp.array4d
        OUTPUT: field whose inverse transform, taken with an unnormalised convention, is
        ``dE/d(mesh)``. Same shape and dtype as ``mesh_fft``; must be zero-initialised.
    virial : wp.array, shape (B,), dtype=wp.mat33f or wp.mat33d
        IN-OUT: the reciprocal-space strain derivative is accumulated when
        ``compute_virial`` is set. Must be zero-initialised.
    wp_dtype : type
        Warp scalar dtype (``wp.float32`` or ``wp.float64``).
    device : str | None
        Warp device string. If None, inferred from arrays.
    compute_virial : bool, default=False
        Whether to accumulate the reciprocal-space virial. This is the only pass that can
        produce it.

    Notes
    -----
    The energy sum carries the real-to-complex multiplicity weight, because it reduces over a
    half spectrum. The cotangent does not: the inverse transform reconstructs the unstored
    half itself, so weighting it as well would double-count every interior bin.

    atomic adds whose contribution is negligible. It is not free, though, because the
    interpolation is what the forces are differentiated through. Dropping a stencil point
    removes its gradient as well as its value, and while the energy shifts by a negligible
    amount the force does not: for an atom sitting a thousandth of a cell from a boundary a
    quarter of the stencil falls below the threshold, and the resulting force error survives
    mesh refinement.
