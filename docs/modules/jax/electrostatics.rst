:mod:`nvalchemiops.jax.interactions.electrostatics`: Electrostatics
====================================================================

.. currentmodule:: nvalchemiops.jax.interactions.electrostatics

The electrostatics module provides GPU-accelerated implementations of
long-range electrostatic interactions for molecular simulations with **JAX** bindings.
These functions accept standard ``jax.Array`` inputs.

.. tip::
    For the underlying framework-agnostic Warp kernels, see :doc:`../warp/electrostatics`.

High-Level Interface
--------------------

These are the primary entry points for most users. They are compatible with
``jax.jit`` when setup-only PME parameters such as ``mesh_dimensions`` and
``alpha`` are supplied explicitly whenever those values would otherwise be
estimated from traced inputs. ``miller_bounds`` is also a static shape control:
under ``jax.jit``, pass it as a concrete tuple or build ``k_vectors`` outside
the compiled function.
Energy derivatives are defined for positions, charges, and cell. Setup values
such as ``alpha`` and mesh controls are constants. The lower-level
``ewald_reciprocal_space`` component follows the tangent carried by its
``k_vectors`` argument. Vectors constructed from ``cell`` in the traced
computation therefore contribute their reciprocal-cell derivative. A
precomputed array, or one passed through ``jax.lax.stop_gradient``, has zero
tangent and is fixed for that differentiation. Full
``ewald_summation(k_vectors=...)`` and PME precomputed metadata treat explicit
vectors as static metadata. Use ``ewald_reciprocal_space_from_miller_indices``
or ``ewald_summation(miller_indices=...)`` for retained topology materialized
from the live cell. Energy-returning Ewald, PME, and slab paths support atom-weighted
losses such as ``(weights * energies).sum()`` for positions, charges, and
supported cell derivatives. Monopole entry points provide the keyword-only
``energy_reduction`` option. The default, ``"atom"``, returns one energy per
atom with shape ``(N,)``. Set it to ``"system"`` to sum energies within each
system and return shape ``(B,)``. Other requested outputs keep their existing
shapes.
For changing-cell full Ewald, retain signed Miller indices with
``generate_ewald_miller_indices`` and pass them through ``ewald_summation``;
the full-Ewald custom-JVP then includes the reciprocal-cell tangent. A retained
topology must cover all intended cells. Enlarging it changes ``K`` and can
trigger JIT recompilation. The legacy ``generate_miller_indices`` remains the
batched bounds helper for static-shape JIT generation.
JAX PME supports first-order cell/strain gradients,
but PME cell/strain HVPs, including full PME with ``slab_correction=True``, are
explicitly unsupported until a native transposable PME cell-HVP path is
implemented and tested.
Point-charge Ewald/PME inputs support ``float32`` and ``float64``. Keep all
floating inputs and precomputed metadata in a call on a consistent dtype.
Import :mod:`nvalchemiops.jax.interactions.electrostatics` before creating JAX
arrays intended to be ``float64`` or compiling JAX functions that operate on
``float64`` arrays. On import, the module sets JAX 64-bit support process-wide,
including when it was previously disabled. This cannot restore precision in
arrays already created as ``float32`` or update functions that JAX has already
compiled. ``float32`` calculations remain supported.

Slab Correction
---------------

Explicit-output Yeh-Berkowitz/Ballenegger slab correction for systems with two
periodic directions. Component-level calls can request energies, forces, charge
gradients, and virials with the same flags used by the Ewald and PME wrappers.
The high-level Ewald and PME wrappers can include the slab term in their energy
autodiff path.
