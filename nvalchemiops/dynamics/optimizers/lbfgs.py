L-BFGS Optimizer Kernels
========================

GPU-accelerated Warp kernels for batched L-BFGS geometry optimization.

L-BFGS is a quasi-Newton method. It builds an implicit approximation to the
inverse Hessian from the last ``m`` position/gradient differences and uses it
to choose a search direction, then picks a step length along that direction
with a line search. Compared with the FIRE optimizers it typically reaches a
given force tolerance in far fewer energy/force evaluations, which is the cost
that dominates relaxation with a machine-learned potential.

Calling convention
------------------
You own the loop. Each call to :func:`lbfgs_step` consumes **exactly one**
energy/force evaluation::

    while True:
        energy, forces = my_model(positions)
        lbfgs_step(positions, forces, energy, ..., batch_idx=batch_idx)
        if not (status.numpy() == LBFGS_NEED_EVAL).any():
            break

Internally each system runs a small state machine that decides whether the
evaluation it was just handed is a line-search trial to accept or reject, or an
accepted point that starts a fresh L-BFGS iteration. Systems in a batch
therefore stay in lock step in *evaluations* while diverging in *iterations*,
which is what lets a whole batch relax in one stream of kernel launches with no
per-system host control flow.

Reading ``status``
------------------
``status`` is the only value you need to inspect:

``LBFGS_NEED_EVAL``
    Keep going: ``positions`` hold a new trial point that needs energy/forces.
``LBFGS_CONVERGED``
    Done: ``positions`` hold the converged geometry.
``LBFGS_LS_FAILED``
    The line search could not make further progress *even from a steepest-descent
    direction with no history*. ``positions`` have been restored to the last
    accepted point. This is *not* a convergence claim; if you consider a stalled
    search with acceptably small forces to be a success, apply that policy
    yourself from ``status`` and the returned forces.

A line search that stalls while history is present is not reported as a
failure. The optimizer rolls back to the last accepted point, discards the
history and continues from steepest descent, which is usually enough to get
moving again. ``iteration`` therefore counts iterations since the most recent
such restart rather than since the beginning of the run.

Forces, not gradients
---------------------
The public API is expressed in **forces**. Because ``F = -grad E``, the
optimizer's gradient is ``g = -F``. No gradient array is ever materialized:
``force_base`` stores forces, and each kernel folds the sign into its own
expression. Two consequences are worth knowing when reading the state:

- ``y_history`` holds *gradient* differences, computed as ``force_base - F``.
- A valid descent direction satisfies ``force_base . d > 0`` (the direction
  points along the force), which is the sign-folded form of ``d0 < 0``.

Precision
---------
Coordinates may be single or double precision, but **all per-system scalars are
float64 regardless**. The Armijo test compares a difference of total energies;
at ``E ~ -1e4 eV`` a float32 ULP is ``~1e-3 eV``, so a single-precision
accumulator would make the line search a coin flip near convergence. The
per-system arrays are ``O(num_systems)`` and the cost is negligible.

Memory
------
The optimizer state costs, for ``P`` degrees of freedom, ``M`` systems and a
history depth ``m``::

    (2m + 3) * 3 * sizeof(dof) * P     per-DOF vectors and the s/y history
  + (4m + 11) * 8 * M                  per-slot and per-system float64 scalars
  +        6  * 4 * M                  per-system int32

``positions`` is not included: it belongs to the caller. The history dominates,
so ``m`` is the knob to turn if memory is tight; 3 to 7 is the usual range. At
``m = 6`` with single-precision coordinates this is 180 bytes per degree of
freedom, or 180 MB at a million.

    A pair is kept only if its curvature ``s . y`` is comfortably positive.
    Exact arithmetic guarantees this under the strong Wolfe conditions, but in
    single precision ``y = g - g_prev`` cancels badly near convergence and the
    scaling ``gamma = ys / yy`` can blow up.

    Discarding is not free: kernel 3 has already written the candidate into the
    slot ``end`` points at, and when the ring is full that slot held the oldest
    valid pair. Clamping ``history_count`` to ``m - 1`` removes exactly that
    now-destroyed entry from the range the recursion walks. When the ring is
    not yet full the slot had never been written, so the clamp does nothing.

    Convergence is also settled here rather than in the state machine, so that
    kernel 3 has already refreshed the base buffers by the time a system is

    Three things happen here, in order.

    First, any system starting a *new* direction restarts its line search at
    ``alpha = 1`` with a zero trial count. This matters more than it looks: the
    two-loop already scales the direction, so a unit step is the Newton step
    and should usually be accepted outright. Inheriting a shrunken step from
    the previous line search would quietly degrade the method to a scaled
    gradient descent. Resetting the trial count also stops it accumulating
    across iterations and tripping ``max_ls_iter`` on a healthy run.

    Second, a direction that fails the descent test is replaced by steepest
    descent rather than reported as a failure. Catching it here, where the
    direction was produced, guarantees the state machine never sees a
    non-descent slope.

    Third, the step length is capped so the resulting Cartesian displacement
    stays within ``maxstep``. The cap is applied on *every* call, not only when
    a direction is new, because a line search that keeps growing the step would
    otherwise walk straight past the limit.

    """Advance the state machine and produce a search direction.

    Runs everything except the position update: the reductions, the
    line-search decision, the history update, and the two-loop recursion. Use
    it together with :func:`lbfgs_prepare_step` and :func:`lbfgs_apply_step`
    when you need to interpose your own logic before the atoms move;
    :func:`lbfgs_step` is the convenience wrapper that chains all three.

    Parameters
    ----------
    positions, forces : wp.array, shape (num_dofs,)
        Current geometry and the forces there. ``positions`` are read, not
        moved; ``lbfgs_apply_step`` does the moving.
    x_base, force_base, direction : wp.array, shape (num_dofs,)
        Last accepted point, its forces, and the current search direction.
    batch_idx : wp.array(dtype=int32), shape (num_dofs,)
        Sorted system index for each degree of freedom. Required.
    s_history, y_history : wp.array, shape (history_size, num_dofs,)
        Ring buffers of position and gradient differences.
    energy : wp.array(dtype=float64), shape (num_systems,)
        Per-system total energy at ``positions``. Use
        :func:`lbfgs_reduce_energy` if your model returns per-atom energies.
    n_particles : wp.array(dtype=int32), shape (num_systems,)
        Atom count per system, for the RMS convergence test. This is the atom
        count, which on a variable-cell path is not the same as the
        degree-of-freedom count.
    force_tol : float, optional
        Convergence threshold on the largest per-atom force magnitude, in the
        force units you supplied. Set to zero to disable.
    rms_tol, stress_tol : float, optional
        Additional convergence thresholds, disabled by default. All enabled
        criteria must hold.
    ftol, wolfe : float, optional
        Armijo and curvature parameters of the strong Wolfe conditions.
    step_scale_down, step_scale_up : float, optional
        Multipliers applied when the line search shrinks or grows the step.
    min_step, max_step : float, optional
        Step length bounds; falling outside them ends the line search.
    max_ls_iter : int, optional
        Trials allowed per line search before giving up.
    maxstep : float, optional
        Largest Cartesian displacement any atom may take in one step. Set to
        zero to disable the trust region.
    curvature_eps : float, optional
        Relative threshold below which a history pair is judged to carry no
        usable curvature and is discarded.
    compute_reductions : bool, optional
        When ``False``, ``gg``/``gd``/``fmax``/``frms_sq`` are taken as given
        rather than recomputed.
    measure_trust_region : bool, optional
        When ``False``, ``dmax`` and ``dquad`` are taken as given. Set this if
        the displacement a direction produces is not simply its magnitude, as
        on a variable-cell path, and supply your own measure before calling
        :func:`lbfgs_prepare_step`.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If array lengths disagree or ``batch_idx`` is missing.

# =============================================================================
# Variable-cell support
#
# Relaxing the cell alongside the coordinates needs an explicit choice of
# generalized coordinates, because the obvious one is wrong. The stress-derived
# cell force is the gradient with respect to an affine deformation in which the
# atoms ride along with the cell. Concatenating raw Cartesian positions with raw
# cell rows gives a coordinate the atoms do *not* follow, so the stored (s, y)
# pairs would pair a displacement in one space with a gradient in another and
# the quasi-Newton model would be built from mismatched quantities.
#
# The chart used here is the one ASE's UnitCellFilter uses. With a reference
# cell H0 captured once at the start, and lattice vectors held as columns so
# that r = H s:
#
#     Phi = H H0^-1          deformation gradient, the identity at the start
#     u   = Phi^-1 r         atom coordinates, in the reference frame
#     c   = kappa * Phi      cell coordinates, six lower-triangular components
#
# with conjugate forces obtained by the chain rule:
#
#     f_u = Phi^T F                    since r = Phi u
#     f_c = -(V sigma) Phi^-T / kappa  since H = Phi H0
#
# Scaling the cell coordinate by kappa and dividing its force by the same
# factor is what keeps g . dx independent of the chart, which is what makes the
# packed pairs genuine secant pairs. The two-loop recursion itself needs no
# changes: it simply runs on the packed array.

    The generalized coordinates are measured relative to a cell ``H0`` that is

    Parameters
    ----------
    positions : wp.array, shape (num_atoms,)
        Cartesian geometry, advanced in place.
    forces : wp.array, shape (num_atoms,)
        Cartesian forces at ``positions``. Forces, not gradients.
    cell : wp.array(dtype=mat33), shape (num_systems,)
        Cell with lattice vectors as columns, advanced in place. Kept
        lower-triangular, so it cannot drift into a rotation.
    stress : wp.array(dtype=mat33), shape (num_systems,)
        Cauchy stress per system. This drives the cell degrees of freedom, and
        is also what ``stress_tol`` is compared against.
    energy : wp.array(dtype=float64), shape (num_systems,)
        Per-system total energy.
    n_particles : wp.array(dtype=int32), shape (num_systems,)
        Atom count per system.
    cell_state : LBFGSCellState
        Chart definition and scratch.
    state : LBFGSState
        Optimizer state, sized for ``num_atoms + 2 * num_systems`` degrees of
        freedom rather than ``num_atoms``.
    force_tol, rms_tol, stress_tol : float, optional
        Convergence thresholds. These are always evaluated on the **Cartesian**
        forces and the stress, never on packed norms, so ``force_tol`` keeps its
        meaning as a force per atom however far the cell deforms.
    maxstep : float, optional
        Largest Cartesian distance an atom may move in one step. On this path
        the displacement is quadratic in the step length, because the cell and
        the coordinates both move, so the cap is solved rather than estimated.
