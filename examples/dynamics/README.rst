Dynamics Examples
=================

This directory contains examples demonstrating the molecular dynamics integrators
and geometry optimization algorithms in nvalchemiops.

All examples use realistic Lennard-Jones (LJ) argon systems to demonstrate
practical workflows with neighbor list management and periodic boundaries.

08_fire_batched.py
    Batched FIRE optimization with two indexing strategies:

    - **batch_idx mode**: Each atom tagged with system index
    - **atom_ptr mode (CSR)**: Atom ranges via pointers
    - Per-system FIRE parameters adapt independently
    - Uses ``nvalchemiops.batch_utils`` for reductions

09_fire2_optimization.py
    FIRE2 geometry optimization for a single LJ cluster.

    - Improved FIRE variant (Guenole et al., 2020)
    - Adaptive damping and coupled step/dt scaling

    - Hyperparameters are Python scalars (no per-system arrays)

10_fire2_batched.py
    Batched FIRE2 optimization with ``batch_idx`` batching.

    - Multiple independent LJ clusters optimized in parallel
    - Per-system FIRE2 parameters adapt independently
    - Only supports ``batch_idx`` mode (no ``atom_ptr`` variant)

11_fire2_variable_cell.py
    Variable-cell FIRE2 optimization for joint atom + cell relaxation.

    - Uses ``fire2_step_coord_cell`` for coupled coordinate/cell updates
    - Preserves fractional coordinates during cell-only motion
    - Simpler state than FIRE (no masses, fewer per-system arrays)

Key Concepts
------------

State Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All algorithms use ``@wp.struct`` containers for clean organization:

- ``MDState``: positions, velocities, forces, masses
- ``FIREState``: MDState + adaptive parameters (dt, alpha, n_positive)
- Integration parameters: ``VerletParams``, ``LangevinParams``, ``FIREParams``

Structs are dtype-agnostic: use ``wp.vec3f``/``wp.float32`` for single
precision or ``wp.vec3d``/``wp.float64`` for double precision.

Two-Pass Integrators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

MD integrators use a two-pass design for flexibility::

    # Pass 1: Update positions and half-step velocities
    velocity_verlet_position_update(state, params)

    # User computes forces at new positions
    compute_forces(state.positions, state.forces)

    # Pass 2: Complete velocity update
    velocity_verlet_velocity_finalize(state, state.forces, params)

This allows any force calculation method to be used between the passes.

Batching Modes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For processing multiple systems efficiently:

- **batch_idx**: Array mapping each atom to its system index. Flexible for
  heterogeneous systems but requires atomic accumulation.

- **atom_ptr (CSR)**: Pointer array where system *s* owns atoms
  ``[atom_ptr[s], atom_ptr[s+1])``. More efficient for homogeneous batches.

Use ``nvalchemiops.batch_utils`` for conversions and per-system reductions.

Variable-Cell Optimization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``cell_filter`` utilities enable joint optimization of positions and cell
with FIRE. FIRE2 variable-cell optimization should use the coupled
``fire2_step_coord_cell`` adapter, which applies the affine coordinate remap
implied by cell motion.

Generic cell-filter workflow for optimizers such as FIRE::

    # 1. Align cell to upper-triangular form
    positions, cell = align_cell(positions, cell)

    # 2. Pack atomic + cell DOFs into extended arrays
    extended_pos = pack_positions_with_cell(positions, cell, ...)
    extended_forces = pack_forces_with_cell(forces, cell_force, ...)

    # 3. Run optimizer on extended arrays
    fire_step(extended_pos, extended_vel, extended_forces, ...)

    # 4. Unpack results
    positions, cell = unpack_positions_with_cell(extended_pos, ...)
