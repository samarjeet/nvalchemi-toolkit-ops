## High-performance NVIDIA Warp primitives for computational chemistry

NVIDIA ALCHEMI Toolkit-Ops is a collection of **GPU-optimized**, **batched**
primitives for accelerating atomistic simulations. High performance compute
kernels are written in [NVIDIA `warp-lang`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/warp).

### Key Features

- **Neighbor lists**
  - Naive, cell-list, and tiled cluster-pair methods
  - Matrix and COO formats
  - Automatic method selection
  - Custom pair functions
- **Molecular dynamics**
  - NVE, NVT, NPT, and NPH ensembles
  - Langevin, Nosé-Hoover Chain, and velocity-rescaling thermostats
- **Geometry optimization with FIRE, FIRE2, and L-BFGS**, supporting coordinate and
  lattice relaxation
- **Interatomic interactions**
  - DFT-D3(BJ) dispersion
  - DSF, Ewald, and PME electrostatics
  - Ewald and PME for charges and multipoles (Warp/PyTorch)
- **Differentiable electrostatics for PyTorch training**, with automatic
  differentiation for forces, charge gradients, virials, and stress
- **Core kernels written in `warp-lang`** with PyTorch and JAX bindings

Kernels are naturally intended to be highly scalable (>100,000 atoms) and generally
optimized for high throughput operations (on the order of several microseconds per
atom) on GPUs, with batching support.

### Use Cases

There are currently three primary use cases where we imagine `nvalchemi-toolkit-ops` to
fit into the ecosystem:

- Library maintainers and developers are encouraged to benchmark and explore
integrating functionality like neighbor list computation to accelerate
existing workflows;
- Researchers and model developers ideally should be able to rely on
this package (and not implement their own!) for neighbor list computation,
interatomic interactions, and so on during method development;
- Engineers looking to build applications that involve molecular dynamics,
interatomic potentials, and the like can take advantage of optimized and
maintained low-level kernels. `warp-lang` kernels should be sufficiently
modular to allow for a high degree of flexibility and reusability.

The combination of being GPU-first and batched should enable the kernels contained
in `nvalchemi-toolkit-ops` to be ready for a wide range of research and production
applications.

### Example Snippets

We encourage interested readers to browse our hosted
[documentation](https://nvidia.github.io/nvalchemi-toolkit-ops). Below are some
short snippets that highlight our straightforward API and use cases
for PyTorch: see the hosted documentation for Jax details.

<details>
<summary>Neighbor list in a 2D unit cell with 50,000 atoms</summary>

This example uses PyTorch:

```python
import torch
from nvalchemiops.torch.neighbors import neighbor_list

torch.set_default_dtype(torch.float32)
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
torch.set_default_device(device)

NUM_ATOMS = 50_000
# distribute positions inside the cell
positions = torch.rand((NUM_ATOMS, 3)) * 100.0
cell = (torch.eye(3, dtype=torch.float32) * 100.0).unsqueeze(0)
pbc = torch.tensor([True, True, False], dtype=torch.bool)
cutoff = 6.0
# use padded matrix representation for neighbors, optimal for
# compiled applications that need constant shapes
neighbor_matrix, num_neighbors, shift_matrix = neighbor_list(
    positions,
    cutoff,
    cell=cell,
    pbc=pbc,
    method="cell_list"
)
# ...or pass `return_neighbor_list=True` for the familiar COO
# `edge_index` format. `method` will also automatically determine
# neighbor algorithm based off system size
edge_index, neighbor_ptr, shifts = neighbor_list(
    positions,
    cutoff,
    cell=cell,
    pbc=pbc,
    return_neighbor_list=True
)

```

<summary>DFT-D3(BJ) corrections on a batch of molecules</summary>

This example assumes you already have concatenated a set of molecules
into combined tensors, and have computed some form of neighborhood
using the `neighbor_list` API. Here, we'll demonstrate using the
matrix representation:

```python
import torch
from nvalchemiops.torch.interactions.dispersion import dftd3
from nvalchemiops.torch.neighbors import neighbor_list

# the following parameters need to be constructed ahead of time
positions = ...  # [num_atoms, 3]
atomic_numbers = ...  # [num_atoms]
cell = ...  # [num_systems, 3, 3]
pbc = ...  # [num_systems, 3]
batch_idx = ...  # [num_atoms]
batch_ptr = ...  # [num_systems + 1]
# construct neighbor matrix
neighbor_matrix, num_neighbors, shift_matrix = neighbor_list(
    positions,
    cutoff=...,  # on the order of ~20 Angstroms
    cell=cell,
    pbc=pbc,
    batch_idx=batch_idx,
    batch_ptr=batch_ptr
)
# DFT-D3 parameters need to be provided, which comprises reference C6 parameters.
# Refer to the user documentation to see the expected structure and data source.
d3_params = ...
# pass everything to the functional interface
d3_energies, d3_forces, coord_nums, d3_virials = dftd3(
    positions=positions,
    numbers=atomic_numbers,
    neighbor_matrix=neighbor_matrix,
    neighbor_matrix_shifts=shift_matrix,
    batch_idx=batch_idx,
    cell=cell,
    # functional specific DFT-D3 parameters (PBE shown)
    a1=0.4289, a2=4.4407, s8=0.7875,
    d3_params=d3_params,
    compute_virial=True
)
```

<summary>Electrostatics via particle mesh Ewald</summary>

This example shows how to compute the per-atom and system energies
as well as the forces using the particle mesh Ewald interface.

```python
import torch
from nvalchemiops.torch.interactions.electrostatics import particle_mesh_ewald
from nvalchemiops.torch.neighbors import neighbor_list

# the following parameters need to be constructed ahead of time
positions = ...  # [num_atoms, 3]
atomic_numbers = ...  # [num_atoms]
cell = ...  # [num_systems, 3, 3]
pbc = ...  # [num_systems, 3]
atomic_charges = ... # [num_atoms]
positions = positions.requires_grad_(True)
# construct neighbor matrix
neighbor_matrix, num_neighbors, shift_matrix = neighbor_list(
    positions,
    cutoff=...,  # on the order of ~20 Angstroms
    cell=cell,
    pbc=pbc,
)
# call PME, using automatic parameter tuning
atom_energies = particle_mesh_ewald(
    positions=positions,
    charges=atomic_charges,
    cell=cell,
    neighbor_matrix=neighbor_matrix,
    neighbor_matrix_shifts=shift_matrix,
    accuracy=1e-6
)
system_energy = atom_energies.sum()
atom_forces = -torch.autograd.grad(system_energy, positions)[0]
```

## CUDA 13 Support

CUDA 13 is required for Blackwell GPUs. `torch>=2.11.0` and `jax[cuda13]`
publish CUDA 13 wheels on the default PyPI index for Linux x86_64 and
aarch64 platforms.

The `torch` and `jax` extras use CUDA 13 by default and are equivalent to the
explicit `torch-cu13` and `jax-cu13` extras. Use `torch-cu12` and `jax-cu12`
when CUDA 12.6 PyTorch wheels or CUDA 12 JAX plugins are required. The PyTorch
indexes used for explicit CUDA selection are `cu130` for CUDA 13 and `cu126`
for the CUDA 12 fallback.

```bash
# Standalone install
uv venv --seed --python 3.12
uv pip install nvalchemi-toolkit-ops torch==2.11.0

# Explicit CUDA 13 PyTorch wheel index
uv pip install nvalchemi-toolkit-ops \
    torch==2.11.0+cu130 \
    --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130
```

See the [installation guide](https://nvidia.github.io/nvalchemi-toolkit-ops/userguide/about/install.html#cuda-13-installation)
for details.

## Roadmap

Features planned for the next release:

- PME dispersion
- Faster short-range calculations for small systems
- Performance improvements for neighbor lists and multipole
  electrostatics
